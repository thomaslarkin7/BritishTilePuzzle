                    Scientific advances in the photographic reproduction domain - allowing multiple positive image copies 
                    to be made from a single negative copy - first made it possible to add photographs to books. 
                    Whilst this process was initially expensive, over the following decades the production costs were 
                    lowered and photographs became more widely used in books for the mass market.<br><br> 
                    Photographically illustrated books represented and reflected the interests, pursuits and innovations 
                    of the era. Building on foundations in both art and science, photography's intrinsic ability to 
                    record reality encouraged photographers to explore and capture the world around them.<br><br>
                    Photographically illustrated books provide a unique snapshot of the past and an insight into the 
                    novel concept of pairing images and text. They both illustrate and illuminate the aesthetic, 
                    intellectual and social development of the Victorian age."<br><br>
